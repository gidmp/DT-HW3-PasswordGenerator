# DT-HW3-PasswordGenerator
Homework 3 of UW coding bootcamp

In this homework, the goal is to manipulate javascript using Visual Studio Code in order to create a random password generator where the user are given freedom to choose what kind of characters used as the building block.

Since the HTML, CSS and a small portion of the javascript already given, I only work on the javascript part to make this application work. Here are the simplified steps of my process:

1. make a list of characters that we want to use in a form of either string or array and store them in a variable

2. asking user input using prompt() and confirm() then store them in variable

3. determine the length of the password desired by the user and store them in a variable.

4. Take user's input and apply them using if else statement and combine the array into one giant array using concat()

5. use for loop to get the characters from the array randomly, set the length limit of the loop based on the password length prompt and print them on the application screen.
